Description: Characterization of a mid-summer drought (MSD) with precipitation
    based statistics. The MSD is a phenomenon of decreased rainfall during a 
    typical rainy season. It is a feature of rainfall in much of Central America
    and is also found in other locations, typically those with a Mediterranean 
    climate. Details on the metrics are in Maurer et al. (2022)
